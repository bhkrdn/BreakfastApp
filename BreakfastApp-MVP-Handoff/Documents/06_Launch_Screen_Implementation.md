# üìù 06 - Launch Screen Implementation

## üéØ Goal
Implement a visually appealing launch screen for the BreakfastApp that follows the UI style guide and establishes brand identity during app startup.

## üìÇ Files Involved
- **Create:** `BreakfastApp/SupportingFiles/LaunchScreen.storyboard`
- **Modify:** Project settings in Xcode for launch screen configuration
- **Add Images:** `Assets.xcassets/LaunchScreen.imageset/`
- **Reference:** `BreakfastApp-MVP-Handoff/Xcode-Setup/BreakfastApp_LaunchScreen_Handoff.pdf`
- **Reference:** `BreakfastApp-MVP-Handoff/Xcode-Setup/UI-Style-Guide.md`

## ‚úÖ Task Breakdown

### 1. Setup Launch Screen Assets
- [x] Create/verify `AppIcon` image is available in asset catalog
- [ ] Ensure images are available in @1x, @2x, and @3x resolutions if needed
- [ ] Verify image formats conform to Apple's recommendations (PNG preferred)

### 2. Create Launch Screen Storyboard
- [x] Create the new file `LaunchScreen.storyboard` in the SupportingFiles directory
- [x] Implement storyboard with:
  - [x] Background color matching app theme (#FDF7F2)
  - [x] Centered app logo/icon with appropriate sizing (150x150)
  - [x] App name text using the accent color and bold font 
  - [x] Apply consistent spacing and layout per style guide

### 3. Configure Launch Screen in Xcode
- [x] Open the project in Xcode
- [x] Select the project in the navigator 
- [x] Go to the "Info" tab in the project settings
- [x] Set "UILaunchStoryboardName" to "LaunchScreen" under UILaunchScreen dictionary
- [x] Optionally, configure any additional launch screen settings
- [ ] Test launch screen across different device sizes

### 4. Test Launch Screen Performance
- [ ] Test launch time with storyboard implementation
- [ ] Verify the launch screen appears correctly on cold start
- [ ] Confirm the transition to the main app interface is smooth
- [ ] Test on multiple device sizes (iPhone SE, standard iPhone, Max sizes)

### 5. Alternative Approaches (For Future Reference)
- [ ] Document pros/cons of storyboard vs. SwiftUI launch screen approach:
  - Storyboard advantages: faster loading, standard approach, wide device support
  - SwiftUI advantages: code-based, easier to animate, consistent with rest of app

### 6. Styling & Testing
- [x] Ensure all elements conform to `UI-Style-Guide.md`
- [ ] Test on multiple device sizes (iPhone SE, standard iPhone, Max sizes)
- [ ] Verify orientation behavior (portrait/landscape if supported)
- [ ] Confirm launch screen displays correctly in light/dark mode
- [ ] Measure and optimize launch time performance

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update project documentation to reference the launch screen implementation
- [ ] Document any considerations for future updates or maintenance
